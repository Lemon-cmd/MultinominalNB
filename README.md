# Naive Bayes Classifier C++ #          

***A C++ Implementation of Naive Bayes Classifier. Please take a look at the given dataset*** !              

For using a different dataset, please consider using the **last column in the data as the test feature or Y**. If not, then you will have to change up the code.       

# Dataset Tips      
It is up to you to clean your data. There are many ways people separate different columns in their dataset. Please simply update the load method to do the splitting based on your **targeted dataset** 

# Please don't use features with only 1 and 0! #             
  - This is not a multinominal NB classifier. It will be up on a different repository!     
  - This is not a Guassian NB classifier. It will be up on a different repository !      
        
# How to use the NB #    
  - Simply run the bash script to build and run  
  - If you want to target a different trainning and test set, simply go into the main function and change the loadTrainD() and loadTestD() methods to target different files.   
  - If you want to modify the code for your own needs, go ahead.
